<h1>Imperial Star Destroyer</h1>
<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. What?! Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! What?!</p>
<h2>The Clone Wars</h2>
<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</li>
<li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
<li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
<h4>The Battle for Endor</h4>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
<ol>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
<li>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Return of the Jedi</h5>
<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
<h6>Knights of the Old Republic</h6>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I call it luck. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide.</p>
<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; I'm trying not to, kid. Red Five standing by.</p>
<p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I call it luck. What?!</p>
<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
<p>What?! I find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Ye-ha! Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; I find your lack of faith disturbing. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. What!? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't underestimate the Force. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
<p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Ye-ha! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
